                <h2>BEGINNING</h2>
                <p>Gengo started with a simple observation: language learners needed a better way to practice. Traditional platforms were either too rigid or too unfocused. We envisioned a space where learners could connect naturally with native speakers, free from the distractions and concerns found on general chat platforms.</p>

                <p>Unlike unrestricted platforms, Gengo focuses on creating meaningful language learning experiences. We match learners with native speakers who share the same goal: authentic cultural exchange and language mastery.</p>
